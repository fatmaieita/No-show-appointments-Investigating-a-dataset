# No-show-appointments-Investigating-a-dataset
In this project, we analyze a dataset that includes no show doctor appointments. 

# Overview
In this project, we look at no-show appointments from doctors office. The purpose is to understand the factors that make a patient attend his appointment or not.
The factors include: scheduled day, the neighborhood of the patient, how many days between scheduled day and appointment day, which day the appointment is on, the age of the patient, some chronic diseases the patient might have. I also used the matplotlib library to visualize the data.
